Assignments for ATLS 4120

I wish to build a navigation APP for the students with disability at CU Boulder to find a safe way to the class building during winter, especially on the snow day. The users can report which path is covered by snow. The facilities would know which path needs to be clear first. Before the path is clean, the system will make a temporary detour for the users. In addition, if the destination building doesn't have accessible equipment(elevator, ramp, etc) the system will notify the user when they want to navigate to that building.
I want to use mapping API, maybe Google Map
